# The correct short name is "Java EE"

When the enterprise Java platform was first introduced, it was called
"Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition", with the abbreviation "J2EE".
When we
[revised the naming of the Java platform](http://java.com/en/about/javanaming.jsp),
we [didn't just drop the "2"](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=35561).

One of the big reasons we changed the names of the platforms is because
we wanted to emphasize that they're all "Java". The old names of "J2EE,
"J2SE", and "J2ME" don't do that. Java is what's important to us. Java
is why we're here. Java is the value we share. We need to make that
clear to the world by talking about "Java EE".

Please, use only the correct name "Java EE".  If that's too much to say
or type, call it "EE".  (No, not "double-E".)

Thanks.
